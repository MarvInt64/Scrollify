# Scrollify

Scrollify is a SwiftUI-based macOS application designed to enhance the user's scrolling experience with third party mice. With Scrollify, users can adjust the scrolling sensitivity and deceleration rate, and choose from a set of ease modes, giving them the ability to tailor their scrolling experience to their personal preferences.

## Features:

1. **Smooth Scrolling Activation**: Turn smooth scrolling on or off with a simple toggle.
2. **Deceleration Rate Adjustment**: Use a slider to adjust the deceleration rate of the scroll.
3. **Scroll Sensitivity Adjustment**: Modify the sensitivity of the scroll with a slider, providing a customizable feel.
4. **Easing Effects**:
   - **Quart**: A smooth, polynomial-based easing.
   - **Elastic**: DOES NOT WORK YET! An ease function that gives an elastic "bounce" feel to the scroll.
   - **EaseOutBounce**: DOES NOT WORK YET! A bounce effect that simulates a bouncing object coming to rest.

5. **Test Area**: A space in the app where users can test out their chosen settings in real-time.
